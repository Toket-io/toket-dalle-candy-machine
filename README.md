# Toket Demo App

This demo app generates NFTs using OpenApi Dalle2 API and Toket API. Check out the [live demo](https://demo.toket.io/) and feel free to provide feedback or contribute.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- OpenApi API key
- Toket API key

### Before you begin

1. Create a `.env.local` file.
2. Populate the file using the `.env.example` as reference.

### Run locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app. You can edit the app by modifying the `pages/index.tsx` file. The page will automatically update as you make changes.
